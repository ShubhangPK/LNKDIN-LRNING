Writing a C Program includes the following steps:-

a. Firstly, writing the source code itself

b. Compile the source code into Object code

c. Link the object code with a library (taken care by a linker) in order to create an executable program.


In this lesson we learn about the following concepts :-

a. Using C library libxml2 to create and manipulate the XML files 
	Usage of XML (data interchange format) - describe, store and transport data
		1. To describe data - usage of tags. Eg. <xml> data </xml>
		2. Prolog tag - <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> ; For XML library - libxml2

	Standard compilation command - 

	clang -Wall <library> <file-being-compiled>
	
	Excercise file - Chapter 2 - [Refer http://xmlsoft.org/ for further exploration]

b. Using C library JSON
	JSON abbreviated as - JavaScript Object Notation - is a Data Interchange Format
	Usage of JSON lib in C - https://github.com/json-c/json-c
